# My Practices

This is a repository only for the exercises I've done while studying Python, courses or challenges on CodeWars. 

My objective in posting those is to keep track more easily of what I've done, to use more Github and to in the future so I can revisit these scripts to keep in mind my evolution learning Python and the logic of things.

Feel free to learn from those scripts if you find some sense into it, but I ask to not copy and paste those on the challenges to use them as your own.
